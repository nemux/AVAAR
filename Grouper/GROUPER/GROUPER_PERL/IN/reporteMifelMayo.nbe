This means that the data returned by the SQL ping is inaccurate for newer releases of SQL Server.\n\nSolution :\n\nIf there is only a single SQL instance installed on the remote host, consider filter incoming traffic to this port.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nNone\n\nPlugin output :\nA 'ping' request returned the following information about the remote\nSQL instance :\n\n  ServerName   : SEGURIDAD\n  InstanceName : AXSNET\n  IsClustered  : No\n  Version      : 9.00.1399.06\n  tcp          : 1180\n  np           : \\\\SEGURIDAD\\pipe\\MSSQL$AXSNET\\sql\\query\n  via          : SEGURIDAD,0:1433\n\n\n\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected.

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the- middle attack against the remote host.\n\nSolution :\n\nPurchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n\n\nPlugin output :\nThe following certificate was at the top of the certificate\nchain sent by the remote host, but is signed by an unknown\ncertificate authority :\n\n|-Subject : C=MX/CN=Mifel/L=Mexico D.F./OU=Infraestructura/O=Banca Mifel/ST=Miguel Hidalgo/E=bernardo.maya@mifel.com.mx\n|-Issuer  : C=MX/CN=Mifel/L=Mexico D.F./OU=Infraestructura/O=Banca Mifel/ST=Miguel Hidalgo/E=bernardo.maya@mifel.com.mx\n\n\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

results|10.10.10|10.10.10.101|www (443/tcp)|51192|Security Warning|Synopsis :\n\nThe SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.\n\nDescription :\n\nThe server's X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the- middle attack against the remote host.\n\nSolution :\n\nPurchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n\n\nPlugin output :\nThe following certificate was part of the certificate chain\nsent by the remote host, but has expired :\n\n|-Subject   : C=MX/ST=Distrito Federal/L=Distrito Federal/O=Banca Mifel S.A.

This is the method Microsoft recommends to determine if a patch has been applied. \n\nIf your Nessus scanner does not have administrative privileges when doing a scan, then Nessus has to fall back to perform a patch audit through the registry which may lead to false positives (especially when using third-party patch auditing tools) or to false negatives (not all patches can be detected through the registry).\n\nSolution :\n\nReconfigure your scanner to use credentials with administrative privileges.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nNone\n\nPlugin output :\nIt was not possible to connect to '\\\\XERVSHPP\\ADMIN$' with the supplied credentials.\n\n\n

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the- middle attack against the remote host.\n\nSolution :\n\nPurchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n\n\nPlugin output :\nThe following certificate was at the top of the certificate\nchain sent by the remote host, but is signed by an unknown\ncertificate authority :\n\n|-Subject : C=DE/L=Cadolzburg/O=HOB GmbH & Co.

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n

Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the- middle attack against the remote host.\n\nSolution :\n\nPurchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n\n\nPlugin output :\nThe following certificate was at the top of the certificate\nchain sent by the remote host, but is signed by an unknown\ncertificate authority :\n\n|-Subject : C=USA/ST=CA/L=Pleasanton/O=AdventNet Inc./OU=AdventNet Inc./CN=demo.securitymanagerplus.com\n|-Issuer  : C=USA/ST=CA/L=Pleasanton/O=AdventNet Inc./OU=AdventNet Inc./CN=demo.securitymanagerplus.com\n\n\n

In theory, a determined attacker may be able to leverage this weakness to generate another certificate with the same digital signature, which could allow him to masquerade as the affected service.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279\nhttp://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/961509\n\nSolution :\n\nContact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 4.0\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n\n\nPlugin output :\nHere is the service's SSL certificate :\n\nSubject Name: \n\nCountry: USA\nState/Province: CA\nLocality: Pleasanton\nOrganization: AdventNet Inc.\nOrganization Unit: AdventNet Inc.\nCommon Name: demo.securitymanagerplus.com\n\nIssuer Name: \n\nCountry: USA\nState/Province: CA\nLocality: Pleasanton\nOrganization: AdventNet Inc.\nOrganization Unit: AdventNet Inc.\nCommon Name: demo.securitymanagerplus.com\n\nSerial Number: 46 7F BD 90 \n\nVersion: 1\n\nSignature Algorithm: MD5 With RSA Encryption\n\nNot Valid Before: Jun 25 13:05:20 2007 GMT\nNot Valid After: Jun 22 13:05:20 2017 GMT\n\nPublic Key Info: \n\nAlgorithm: RSA Encryption\nKey Length: 1023 bits\nPublic Key: 5E 74 F7 02 0D 00 F8 41 94 11 65 55 18 5B 29 63 D6 66 82 B2 \n            6F 36 82 00 64 6D CD 1B 38 10 E1 7B D5 E5 9B D2 16 B0 8E 9F \n            4C 56 5C 1B C6 EE 2D F8 EA 40 F9 61 BB E6 EF 06 C8 D8 C2 3E \n            9A 0A 2A E3 76 C0 CE A7 17 C5 A5 66 56 37 8B 31 64 BD 77 DC \n            66 5F EF 6D 35 CE 17 FE E1 ED 3F F9 93 D2 06 CA FA 24 48 97 \n            7B D1 87 79 81 C1 37 83 6A A4 2B BD 63 A8 05 AA B8 31 94 4D \n            98 36 0B D3 98 B6 A5 53 \nExponent: 01 00 01 \n\nSignature Length: 128 bytes / 1024 bits\nSignature: 00 43 2C 6D CD 7D 0A 88 4E 35 EF FA F6 95 EE 16 D1 34 15 4F \n           E2 CF 59 77 24 B8 A2 4D D9 DB 83 2F FC B0 C0 65 5E D8 29 36 \n           12 B9 DF 06 55 91 5D 69 AC 44 E3 F1 B3 48 7B F8 C0 80 E7 4A \n           49 E2 2A 1D 8B 6F 43 26 34 11 40 E3 B1 F0 EB D8 67 49 E1 9D \n           25 4D E7 7E CB 03 86 F1 95 1B 0E AE E6 F8 09 D9 15 33 B3 A8 \n           29 B2 62 15 29 09 6E 32 7F 51 63 EE FB E7 22 4D 24 7D 5B 1B \n           6A 39 D1 D2 1C B4 9D 20 B8 \n\n\n\nCVE : CVE-2004-2761\nBID : 11849,33065\nOther references : OSVDB:45106,OSVDB:45108,OSVDB:45127,CERT:836068,CWE:310\n

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf\nhttp://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx\n\nSolution :\n\n- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and\n- Select the 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication' setting if it is available.\n\nRisk factor :\n\nMedium / CVSS Base Score : 5.1\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)\n\nCVE : CVE-2005-1794\nBID : 13818\nOther references : OSVDB:17131\n
